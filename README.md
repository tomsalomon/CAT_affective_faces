# CAT_affective_faces
Codes and data of two CAT experiments with affective faces examining  the association with depression tendency.

Cheak out the PDF [Report](https://github.com/tomsalomon/CAT_affective_faces/blob/main/MainAnalysisReport.pdf) in this git's main page, to see a summary of the results of both experiments. The repo also contains the original (MATLAB) codes used to run the experiments and the raw output file. All rights-protected resources (image stimuli of faces and fractals) were not included in the repo. 

A preregistration for Experiment 2 can be found in this [OSF project](osf.io/nt6u5/).

Feel free to contact me for any additonal information and thoughts.
